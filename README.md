# To-Do-List-Project-
To Do List- As part of a Web Based Information Systems course for Information Systems, I implemented a system that simulated a group To Do List for handling tasks. There were two sides, the client and the server side that included a database. the server side simulated by the program 'xampp'. The server side is in PHP and includes the use of Access databases, sending/receiving JSON data. The client side is in HTML, JavaScript (include JQUREY), CSS and Vue.js and includes the use of sending/receiving JSON data. The project is Responsive Web App for computers and mobile.
